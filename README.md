# Python-Intermediate-Project
***Taking it up a Notch with Python***

# **Repository Description:**

Welcome to the Intermediate Python Projects repository!

This repository contains a collection of intermediate-level Python projects designed to enhance your skills in data analysis and visualization. Utilizing a comprehensive housing dataset, these projects offer practical experience in handling real-world data. The repository includes the following key files:

- **Project on Python Intermediate.docx:** This document outlines the project tasks and provides detailed descriptions and guidelines.
- **Python_Intermediate_Project.ipynb:** A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the project tasks, showcasing data analysis, visualization, and manipulation techniques.
- **2198208-housing.xlsx:** The Excel dataset used in this project, containing various attributes related to housing data.

# **Included Projects:**

1. **Average Median Income Analysis:**
   - Calculate the average median income from the dataset and visualize its distribution using appropriate plots. Analyze and explain the characteristics of the distribution.

2. **Housing Median Age Distribution:**
   - Create visualizations to explore the distribution of housing median age. Provide observations and insights based on the plots.

3. **Income and House Value Relationship:**
   - Use visualizations to examine the relationship between median income and median house values. Interpret the correlation between these variables.

4. **Data Cleaning by Removing Missing Values:**
   - Clean the dataset by removing entries with missing values in the total_bedrooms column. Create a new dataset with these modifications.

5. **Data Imputation with Mean Values:**
   - Handle missing data by filling in the missing total_bedrooms values with the mean value. Create and analyze the resulting dataset.

6. **Custom Median Calculation Function:**
   - Develop a user-defined function to calculate the median value of a dataset. Apply this function where necessary in your analysis.

7. **Geographical Data Visualization:**
   - Plot latitude versus longitude to visualize the geographical distribution of the housing data. Provide observations and insights from the plot.

8. **Filtering Data by Proximity to Ocean:**
   - Filter the dataset to include only entries where the ocean_proximity attribute is 'Near_ocean'. Create a new dataset with this criterion.

9. **Statistical Analysis of Filtered Data:**
   - Calculate the mean and median of the median income for the dataset filtered by ocean proximity ('Near_ocean'). Analyze the results.

10. **Categorizing Bedroom Sizes:**
    - Add a new column to the dataset named total_bedroom_size. Classify the total bedrooms into categories ('small', 'medium', 'large') based on specified criteria.

# **How to Use:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Documentation:** Start with the `Project on Python Intermediate.docx` file to get an overview of the project tasks and instructions.
3. **Load the Dataset:** Ensure that the `2198208-housing.xlsx` file is accessible in your working directory.
4. **Run the Notebook:** Open `Python_Intermediate_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to execute and explore the code.
5. **Experiment and Analyze:** Modify the code, add your observations, and experiment with different visualizations and data manipulations.
